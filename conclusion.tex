Actario is currently under development and still does not provide
convenient libraries of predicates, lemmas, tactics and so
forth. Thus, verifying a user-defined actor system may involve a large
amount of work. However, we have formally proved that the underlying
execution model provided in the framework satisfies three important
actor properties: name uniqueness, actor persistence and name
persistence. The fact implies that a system described using Actario is
guaranteed to have these actor properties.
