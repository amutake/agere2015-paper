\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we present Actario, a Coq framework for describing and
verifying actor-based systems. Actario is designed to support implicit
naming of actors. This simplifies the description of actor systems.
We have formally proved that the underlying execution model provided
in the framework satisfies important properties including name
uniqueness, actor persistence and message persistence.  The fact
implies that a system described using Actario is guaranteed to have
these actor properties.

Actario is currently under development and still does not provide
convenient libraries of predicates, lemmas, tactics and so
forth. Thus, verifying a user-defined actor system may involve a large
amount of work. Providing such libraries should be included in the
future work.

In addition, we like to extend Actario to suppor extended Actor
models. For example, extensions that supports high-level
synchronization mechanisms such as \cite{De-Koster:2012aa},
coordination models\cite{Talcott:2011aa}, and reflective models such
as \cite{Watanabe:2013aa}.
