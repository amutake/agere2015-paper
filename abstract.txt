Abstract:
The two main characteristics of the Actor model are asynchronous
message passing and dynamic system topology. The latter relies on the
on-the-fly creation of actor names that often complicates the formal
treatment of systems described in the Actor model. In this paper, we
introduce Actario, a formalization of the Actor model in Coq. Actario
incorporates a name creation mechanism that is formally proven to
generate a consistent set of actor names. The mechanism helps proper
handling of names in modeling and reasoning about actor-based
systems. Actario also provides a code extraction mechanism that
generates Erlang programs.
